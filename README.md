A hardware password manager, built around a Paspberry Pi Zero and [`pass`, the UNIX password manager](https://passwordstore.org).

## Hardware
I am using a Raspberry Pi Zero, since it has USB-OTG support and a lot of GPIO to interface an OLED screen, a button matrix for input and maybe even an ESP8266 for WiFi. 
The OLED I am intending to use has an IÂ²C interface and a screen diagonal of .96".
